There are are various alternatives out there which dont work for me, or missed stuff like enabling or disable vgtray too from autostart.

Just download all files, and run the Batch as Admin. Use the Stop Batch only if all LoL/Riot Stuff is closed (Game/Client).
Use the Enable Script and restart your PC.
Add "shutdown /r" if you wanna auto restart.

This was tested with DriverView, and with LoL. This no way to cheat or hack Games, just simple script if you dont want keep Vanguard running at all time.
It was made to be extra simple, so even beginners can understand it.
